API notes --

-Espn API has been discontinued
-sports-data (sportradar) is a paid service 13k a month lmaooooo
-Golfscrape from RubyGems... can't guaruntee it will be 100% as it is not that popular and is based off of scraped data. Update: this API is actually no longer functioning after the disabling of Yahoo Sports API


Specs --

1. Tournament needs to be initiated by a valid URL from which golfers can be pulled in - along with other information such as date. The URL from which the updated scores must also be specified 
2. Golfers need to automatically be pulled in by web scraper
3. Only tournament creator can add entrants to the pool (can be changed later other authentication will add quite a bit of time and wouldn't be MVP)


Discuss with Freddy --

- In order to fully set up web scraper pretty sure I'm going to need to set it up during the upcoming US open tournament
- Most of what I've had planned (with regards to having to have you/me/administrator set up the URL for tournaments) is based on sometimes multiple tournaments running at once. I honestly have no idea how golf works, I don't watch it, I've played two full rounds of golf in my life. After looking at yahoo's website for golf I noticed there is something for the PGA tour that says leaderboard. Is it only going to be PGA or Euro LPGA etc?


Notes --

- Need to probably find site that has data accessible for all PGA tournaments




Task notes --
- Have a user join a pool they are not a part of
- First focus on being able to set up tournaments through URL
- Once you can set up future tournaments create a pool
- Once you can create a pool, add participants (via email)
- Once you create the pool for a specific tournament, set up the auto update
- Set up database for players to store id from pga_id, player profile url from pga,
- pool_controller needs edit and destroy actions

- Use secure password hashing on pool passwords
- dont use @join_pool = Pool.new

- have x number of picks instantiated on sign up of the pool
- then if the picks are blank, show the select
